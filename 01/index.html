        <!---- instead of using <br> to style the webpage, it is more time efficient to style with CSS. HTML mainly is utilized for semantic/structuring the webpage -->

                <p>Dear Prof. Price</p>
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                <p>I was told to enrol in this class by someone, I don't know who. It seems like kind of a bad idea but
                    I'm
                    going to do it anyway because I don't have any ideas of my own and anyway I always do what I'm told.
                    I have
                    a couple of questions though, can you please answer them? </p>
                <div>
                    <h1>Assignments</h1>
                </div>
                <p>Are the assignments actually required, or can I just say I did them? In particular I am concerned
                    about the
                    following:

                    - Assignment 1
                    - Assignment 2
                    - All the rest of the assignments</p>
                <div>
                    <h1>Lectures</h1>
                </div>
                <p>Is there any point in coming to class? I looked you up on Rate My Little Pony
                    (https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/840273242953005718/), and your ratings are pretty terrible.</p>
                <div>
                    <h1>Course Website</h1>
                    <p>I have taken a look at the course website. It sure seems pretty weird. Do you mind if I just
                        ignore this
                        part?</p>
