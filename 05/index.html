                      <h2>Main: About Sun Yat Sen</h2>
                      <p>Sun Yat Sen was born in 1866 in Zhongshan, a town in the southeastern province of Guangdong, China. He later would be one of the few leaders, who survived the revolutionary effort that overthrew the Qing Dynasty, and went on to become the founding father of the Republic of China. Curiously, he is regarded as the founding father of 'democratic' China by both the Republicans (Kuomingtang, who later fled to Taiwan) and the Chinese Communist Party. 

                        The reason why I am interested to learn more about this founding father is mainly because of his close connection to my hometown, Hong Kong. Sun Yat Sen came to Hong Kong after spending years with his brother in Hawaii, receiving western education. He studied at Diocesan Boys' School - which happened to be where I did 6 years of secondary school studies. Though, he only spent 1 month at the school, before being expelled, due to his absenteeism - being distracted by his revolutionary pursuits. Later, he studied Medicine in the University of Hong Kong. 

                        Hong Kong, over the past decade, has become once again, a ground for 'revolutionary' ideas.
